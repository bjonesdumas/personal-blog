## What is this list

One of my 2021 programming goals is to contribute to open source projects. I had no idea where to start, or what projects would be welcoming to new contributors. 

While compiling my list I looked at the following things:

* Labels such as "good first issue" or "newbie"
* Detailed contributor guides
* The project's community 
* Personal interest in the project

Taking those requirements into consideration, I came out with a list of 6.
