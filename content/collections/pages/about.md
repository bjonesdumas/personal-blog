Just Britt is fine.

I'm a PHP enthusiast (not a typo), currently obsessing over the TALL stack (Tailwind, Alpine.js, Laravel, and Livewire). 

My latest project is launching Third Coast Studio a Milwaukee based Statamic & Shopify agency committed to providing affordable websites to small businesses and faith communities. 

You will find me most active on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/justbritt_jd)
where you can read my unsolicited opinions about everything under the sun.
